		<h2 class="Heading"> What Is The Scientific Method? </h2>
		<p>The Scientific Method is an empirical method of acquiring knowledge, that has been in practice since at least the 17th century.</p>
		<hr style="width:100%"/>
		<br/>
		<!-- Second Heading, size 3 -->	
		<h3 class="Heading"> So, what does The Scientific Method involve? </h3>
		<img src="Report 1 Multimedia/Scientific-Method-img-1.png" id="NextToParagraph"/>
		<p> It mainly involves careful observation and applying skepticism about what is observed, because Cognitive Assumptions can distort how one interprets the observation. Then, hypothesis are formulated via induction, which works by moving from specific observations to broader generalizations and theories, and it is therefore very open-minded and exploratory, especially at the beginning.</p> 
		<br/><br/>
		<p> Those are the principles of the scientific method. People are naturally inquisitive, they always question what is around them, from what they hear to what they smell or see, and then begin to build ideas and assumptions to explain why things are the way that they are.</p>
		<hr/>
		<p> Here's a video about the history of the scientific method : </p>

		<p> Several fields use the scientific method and their usage may be done in ways different from each other, but the essential basics are usually the same. Those basics can be summed up in the following steps: </p>
		<!-- Ordered List -->
		<ol id="StepsText" type="I">
				<li> <b id="Steps"> Making an observation:</b> <br/>
				<p> As mentioned before, the scientific method essentially starts off from the inquisitive nature of the human mind, where the senses assist the mind in noticing things in the surrounding environment, including smells, sounds and visual stimulation among other senses.</p> </li>
				<br/>
				<li> <b id="Steps"> Ask a question:</b> <br/>
				<p> Since the observations made in the first step are usually very general, a way of narrowing the focus of the inquiry is needed. To identify the problem in specific terms, a question is asked about the observation. These questions don't need a specialist to come up with them, anyone can ask and be inquisitive about an observation and it is not hard either. It all depends on curiosity.</p>Â </li>
				<br/>
				<li> <b id="Steps"> Formulate a hypothesis:</b> <br/>
				<p> Any question needs an answer, and in this step possible answers are made into a hypothesis. [["A hypothesis is often defined as an educated guess because it is almost always informed by what you already know about a topic."]] In this step, intuition can be very helpful, because intuition is gained from a person's conscious intellectual activity, such as thinking, reasoning or remembering. 
				<br/><br/>
			    A hypothesis is usually stated as an "If...then" statement. This requires moving from the general case to a much more specific one. For example, if a car's body profile is related to the amount of air resistance it produces (general statement), then a car designed like the body of a bird will be more aerodynamic and reduce air resistance more than a car designed like a box (specific statement).
			    <br/><br/>
			    There are two very important qualities about a hypothesis expressed as an "If...then" statement. First: it is testable; an experiment could be set up to test the statement. Second, it is also debunkable; an experiment could reveal that the hypothesis is actually not true. If these two qualities are not met, then the question being asked cannot be approached using the scientific method. </p></li>
			    <br/>
				<li> <b id="Steps"> Conduct an experiment :</b> <br/>
				<p> An experiment has to be set up to test a specific hypothesis and it must in a controlled environment.<p/>
				<br/><br/>

				<br/> 
				<li> <b id="Steps"> Analyse data and make a conclusion:</b> <br/>
 				<p> In experiments, data on the findings and processes of the experiment are collected, and hidden in that data is evidence to either support or debunk the hypothesis.</p>
