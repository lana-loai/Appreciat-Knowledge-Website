		<h2 class="Heading"> Research & exploration on Mars, The Red Planet </h2>
		<!-- Introduction -->
		<p> The first step in the long and ongoing journey of exploring Mars was taken by <a href="https://www.space.com/15589-galileo-galilei.html" target="_blank"> Galileo Galilei</a> when he first watched Mars using a telescope. Many more steps were taken in the centuries after to continue that journey, and the most recent step is the invention of <em> robotic spacecrafts </em>.</p>
		<br/>
		<br/> <hr/>

		<!-- Second Heading, size 3 -->	
		<h3 class="Heading"> The Mars Rovers </h3>
		<p> In 2003, Mars passed closer to Earth than anytime in that past 60,000 years. That same year, NASA launched two rovers, nicknamed <i>Spirit</i> and <i>Opportunity</i>, which explored different regions of the Martian surface. Both rovers found signs that water once flowed on the planet's surface.</p>
		<br/> <br/>
		<p> In 2011, NASA's Mars Science Laboratory mission sent the Mars <i>Curiosity</i> rover, to investigate Martian rocks and determine the geologic processes that created them. Among the mission's findings was the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.space.com/26533-curiosity-mars-rover-meteorite-photos.html"> first meteorite</a> on the surface of the Red Planet. The rover has found complex organic molecules on the surface, as well as seasonal fluctuations in methane concentrations in the atmosphere.

		<h4> Current Rover, and its updates </h4> 
		<p> Currently, only one rover has remained in contact on the red planet, that rover is <i> curiosity</i>. So far the <i> Curiosity</i> rover has taken about 701793 images, and has traveled 14.27 miles (22.97 Km). At the moment, <i>Curiosity</i> is making a mile-long journey around some deep sand so that it can explore higher up Mount Sharp.​ It has started a road trip that will continue through the summer across roughly a mile (1.6 kilometers) of terrain. By trip's end, the rover will be able to ascend to the next section of the 3-mile-tall Martian (5-kilometer-tall) mountain it's been exploring since 2014, searching for conditions that may have supported ancient microbial life.</p>
		<br/> <br/>
		<p>The rover's next stop is a part of the mountain called the "sulfate-bearing unit." But between the rover and those sulfates lies a vast patch of sand that Curiosity must drive around to avoid getting stuck. Hence the mile-long road trip: Rover planners, who are commanding Curiosity from home rather than their offices at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, expect to reach the area in early fall, although the science team could decide to stop along the way to drill a sample or study any surprises they come across.</p>

		<h4 class="Heading"> What are the future exploration plans ? </h4>
		<p>NASA has launched a successor rover mission to Curiosity, called <i> Perseverance </i>. This mission will search for ancient signs of life and, depending on how promising its samples look, it may "cache" the results in safe spots on the Red Planet for a future rover to pick up. </p>

		<br/> 
		<p>ESA is working on its own ExoMars rover that should also launch in 2020, and will include a drill to go deep into the Red Planet, collecting soil samples from about 2 meters (6.5 feet) deep. </p>
