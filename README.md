Project Requirements :
For this assignment we are going to build the content of two web pages. 
1. One will be about the scientific method 
2. One will be about another topic from the natural sciences.


Write two brief reports;

These reports will be used as the basis of your first two web pages. These reports need to be in plain text. Some operating systems come with a plain text editor others do not. You will need to find a plain text editor that works with your OS. If you are using a Windows machine, I suggest Notepad++ or Sublime Text. 

Report 1 :

This report is to be about the scientific method. Use the Internet to find a variety of pages that discuss the scientific method. Read enough of these that you understand what is meant by the scientific method. Use this knowledge to write a brief report about the scientific method. Most of this report is to be in your own words. If you copy content from a website be sure to put it in quotes and reference where it came from.

Report 2 :

This report is to be about another scientific topic. The topic can be of your choosing but must be about one of the natural sciences. We have talked a lot about computers and technology in this class. This web page is NOT to be about computers. Instead choose a topic from the following categories of natural science. Don’t choose the entire category, just a single topic within one of the categories:

 Astronomy / Biology/ Chemistry/ Materials Science/ Physics /Earth Science /Atmospheric Science/ Oceanography / Interdisciplinary studies

The Requirements:
Each of the following requirements must be included on at least one of your web pages. When the word common is used, it means it is the same on both of the pages:
•	200-500 words of information on each page
- 2 different types of headings 
- multiple images 
- A horizontal rule 
- A title (this is the title that is displayed in the tab at the top of the browser window)
- multiple paragraphs 
- a list
- a text link 
- a graphic link 
- a table

- the default settings of an 'a'  tag changed 
- a non-default background
- set the height and/or width of an image to something other than default
- a Form
- iFrame
- Audio/ Video
- Create a horizontal navigation bar that includes
- the local link to your scientific method page
- the local link to your other scientific topic page
- one external link to a page about the scientific method
- one external link to a page about your other scientific topic
- The navigation is to be contained in an unordered list
- Change the properties on the list, the list items, and the links to make the navigation look professional
- Give the body a specified width
- Set the body's left and right margins to auto

A common banner** section Common navigation that includes local links to both pages. This is to be an unordered list.
** A banner section is a group of elements that is the same on every page of the website. It is often at the top of the page. You now have 2 pages on your website. Put a section at the top of each page that is the same. This section may contain a heading, a paragraph, an image, a link, etc. 

A common footer*** section that includes the page author and date of last modification • Each page is to include links to at least two external web pages on the topic. Duplicated URLs will only count for one page.

*** A footer section is a group of elements that are the same on every page of the website. It is at the bottom of the webpage. You now have 2 pages on your website. Put a section at the bottom of each page that is the same. This section may contain a heading, a paragraph, an image, a link, etc. Do not use the footer tag as it will not pass validation.
