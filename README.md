Project Requirements :
For this assignment we are going to build the content of two web pages. 
1. One will be about the scientific method 
2. One will be about another topic from the natural sciences
Write two brief reports
These reports will be used as the basis of your first two web pages. These reports need to be in plain text. Some operating systems come with a plain text editor others do not. You will need to find a plain text editor that works with your OS. If you are using a Windows machine, I suggest Notepad++ or Sublime Text. 
Report 1
This report is to be about the scientific method. Use the Internet to find a variety of pages that discuss the scientific method. Read enough of these that you understand what is meant by the scientific method. Use this knowledge to write a brief report about the scientific method. Most of this report is to be in your own words. If you copy content from a website be sure to put it in quotes and reference where it came from.
Report 2
This report is to be about another scientific topic. The topic can be of your choosing but must be about one of the natural sciences. We have talked a lot about computers and technology in this class. This web page is NOT to be about computers. Instead choose a topic from the following categories of natural science. Don’t choose the entire category, just a single topic within one of the categories.
 Astronomy / Biology/ Chemistry/ Materials Science/ Physics /Earth Science /Atmospheric Science/ Oceanography / Interdisciplinary studies

Deciding What to Put on the Web Page
Start with the brief reports you wrote for HW1. Save them as .html files. Be sure you are editing them in a plain text editor. Think of how you can use the information in these reports to create web pages.
Just Content –HTML
This is just the beginning of a web page – deciding what will go in the web page. There will HTML.

Adding Structure 
All the tags you will need are explained in the Web Structure Notes. If you would like another resource for learning HTML I suggest W3 Schools at http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp. 
We will be using XHTML 1.0 strict. For html to meet this standard, you need to use the following DOCTYPE: <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd"> 
Be sure your html tag has the following attributes: <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en" lang="en">
Include this meta tag in your head section: <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"/>

The Requirements
Each of the following requirements must be included on at least one of your web pages. When the word common is used, it means it is the same on both of the pages. 
•	200-500 words of information on each page 
•	2 different types of headings 
•	multiple images 
•	A horizontal rule 
•	A title (this is the title that is displayed in the tab at the top of the browser window)
•	multiple paragraphs 
•	a list
•	a text link 
•	a graphic link 
•	a table
•	2 different, non-default colors 
•	a border with non-default settings
•	 the default settings of an 'a'  tag changed 
•	a non-default background
•	set the height and/or width of an image to something other than default
•	a Form
•	iFrame
•	Audio/ Video
•	Create a horizontal navigation bar that includes
•	the local link to your scientific method page
•	the local link to your other scientific topic page
•	one external link to a page about the scientific method
•	one external link to a page about your other scientific topic
•	The navigation is to be contained in an unordered list
•	Change the properties on the list, the list items, and the links to make the navigation look professional
•	Give the body a specified width
•	Set the body's left and right margins to auto

 A common banner** section Common navigation that includes local links to both pages. This is to be an unordered list.
** A banner section is a group of elements that is the same on every page of the website. It is often at the top of the page. You now have 2 pages on your website. Put a section at the top of each page that is the same. This section may contain a heading, a paragraph, an image, a link, etc. 

A common footer*** section that includes the page author and date of last modification • Each page is to include links to at least two external web pages on the topic. Duplicated URLs will only count for one page.
*** A footer section is a group of elements that are the same on every page of the website. It is at the bottom of the webpage. You now have 2 pages on your website. Put a section at the bottom of each page that is the same. This section may contain a heading, a paragraph, an image, a link, etc. Do not use the footer tag as it will not pass validation.

Add the items listed below.
•	Add Headings
Think of how you could add headings. You might want a large heading at the top of the web page. You might want to use headings to separate your report into different topics.
To add a heading in the content, put the words that will be in the heading followed by a note that says heading. Since we will have different sized heading include the size in the note.
For example: 
The Scientific Method (large heading)
Refining and Repeating (medium heading)
              Add at least two different sizes of headings on each page.
•	Add Images
Pictures are an important part of a webpage. Find images that go with your topic. Decide where you want the pictures to go in relation to the text.
If you use images from the web, download them from the web and save them on your computer. If you use your own images make a copy and save it with your other images.
Save all your images in a single folder. You can put the images in the same folder as your .html files or keep them in a folder of their own. If you keep them in their own folder, put this image folder with your .html files.
Now put a note about each image in your.html file. The note should include a description of the picture followed by the filename. For example:
The WISE telescope in orbit (orbit.jpg)
Man working inside testing tube (testing.png)
View from the WISE telescope (images/view.jpg)
Put these notes where you will want the pictures to be.
Add at least two images on each page.

•	Add Hyperlinks
o	External Links 
External links go to pages that are not on your website. Think about where you can add hyperlinks. Decide which web pages you want to link to. Decide what words you want to be the link. Then add a note about the hyperlink. Include the words and the URL. Remember to include the http://at the beginning of the URL.
o	Local Links 
Local links are links to webpages on your own site. These links are often used to navigate through a website. For this assignment, these will be links to the two pages you are making. Add the navigation for your website by putting two local links on each page. Note: notice if you put two links on each page, one of the links will be to itself. It is common to include self-referencing links in navigation. Decide where you want the navigation to be. Decide what words you want to be the link. Then add a note about the hyperlink. Since we are linking to a .html file in the same folder, remember that you only need to put the filename. Remember to include the extension.
Add navigation with two local links on each page.
o	Graphic Link 
Graphic links are pictures that when you click on them they take you to another page. So instead of having text to go with the hyperlink, you have an image to go with the hyperlink. Decide on which image you want to be a link. Decide which webpage you want the link to go to. This can be either an external link or a local link. Add a note by the image that identifies the link. 
Add at least one graphic link on one of the pages.
•	Add a List 
Add a list to one of your pages. When we think of lists we think of bulleted lists or numbered lists. Plain text editors will not make lists for you so just put a note indicating it is a list. Put each item on the list on a separate line. 
For example: 
	(list) 
	test tube 
	Bunsen burner
	tongs 
	heat source
Submission
When complete, zip your two .html or htm files into a single file. Include your first and last name in the filename of the .zip file. Attach your .zip file to the assignment and submit on e-learning.
